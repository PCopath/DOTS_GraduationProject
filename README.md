# DOTS_GraduationProject
Unity ECS Top-Down Shooter
Overview
This project is a top-down shooter game developed using Unityâ€™s Entity Component System (ECS), Physics, and DOTS-based architecture. The goal is to create a performant and modular game where the player survives against waves of enemies, collects gems, and manages cooldowns, animations, and UI interactions.

Features
Entity-Component-System Architecture
Utilizes Unity ECS for scalable, performant, and data-driven gameplay.

Player Mechanics

Movement and directional animation via PlayerInputSystem and PlayerAnimationManager.

Ranged attack system using PlasmaBlastAuthoring.

Health bar and gem collection tracking in real time.

Enemy AI

Enemy entities track and move toward the player using EnemyMoveToPlayerSystem.

Attack behavior with cooldown management.

Enemies drop collectible gems upon death.

Gem Collection System

Gems can be picked up on collision.
